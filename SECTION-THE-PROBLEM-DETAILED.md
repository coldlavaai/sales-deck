# THE PROBLEM SECTION - Detailed Build Spec

**For:** Cold Lava Sales Deck  
**Position:** Section 2 (after Hero, before Company)  
**Purpose:** Establish the tension that drives decision-making  
**Tone:** Empathetic but direct. We understand because we've been there.

---

## 🎯 THE CORE TENSION

Business owners are stuck between **two opposing fears**:

**Fear 1:** "AI is scary. What if it breaks things? What if I don't understand it? What if I make the wrong choice?"

**Fear 2:** "My competitors are using AI right now and eating my lunch. What if I get left behind?"

**The Result:** Paralysis. They do nothing. And that's the worst option.

**Our Role:** Break the paralysis by being the bridge. Real business people who understand AI, not tech nerds who've never run a business.

**Talking Points (for sales reps):**

### **SLIDE 2: THE AI CIRCUS**

**Heading:** "Everyone's Selling You AI"

**Visual:**
- Grid of caricatured "AI sellers" (abstract icons, not real people):
  - 💼 "The Consultant" - never built anything
  - 🎓 "The Academic" - beautiful theory, zero real-world
  - 🌍 "The Offshore Team" - cheap but disconnected
  - 🏢 "The Enterprise Vendor" - lock you in, charge forever
  - 🤖 "The AI Startup" - will they exist in 2 years?
  - 📊 "The SaaS Platform" - forces you to adapt to THEIR way

**Subtext under each:**
- The Consultant: "Talks a good game. Has never shipped software."
- The Academic: "Brilliant ideas. No understanding of your daily reality."
- The Offshore Team: "Cheap upfront. Expensive when it breaks at 2am."
- The Enterprise Vendor: "Vendor lock-in. Licensing fees forever."
- The AI Startup: "Moving fast. But will they be here next year?"
- The SaaS Platform: "You bend to fit their system. Not the other way."

**Bottom text (centered, larger):**
"None of them have run a business like yours."

**Talking Points:**
- "You've probably talked to all of these."
- "They all promise the moon."
- "But here's what they're missing..."

**Animation:**
- Icons appear one by one (0.3s stagger)
- Subtle red X appears over each (fades in)
- Bottom text fades in last with emphasis

### **SLIDE 3: WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND**

**Heading:** "What Real Business Looks Like"

**Visual:**
- Staggered cards (Cold Lava style) showing real business pain:

**Card 1 (offset left):**
- Icon: 📞 Phone ringing
- "It's 5:47pm on Friday"
- "A lead just called. No one's answering."
- "That's £15,000 to your competitor."

**Card 2 (offset center):**
- Icon: 📊 Spreadsheet
- "You're on your 12th app today"
- "CRM. QuickBooks. Email. WhatsApp. Excel. Google Sheets."
- "Nothing talks to each other."

**Card 3 (offset right):**
- Icon: 🔥 Fire
- "Client asks: 'Can you do X?'"
- "Your system says no."
- "The answer should always be YES."

**Card 4 (below, centered):**
- Icon: 💰 Money
- "You're paying for features you don't use"
- "And missing features you desperately need."
- "Because off-the-shelf means compromise."

**Bottom text:**
"AI won't fix this. The wrong AI will make it worse."

**Talking Points:**
- "These aren't hypothetical. These are real problems we've seen."
- "Generic AI tools don't solve these. They add another app to the pile."
- "You need something different."

**Animation:**
- Cards slide in from sides (staggered timing)
- Subtle "shake" on each when they settle (emphasizing the pain)
- Bottom text fades in with weight

### **SLIDE 4: THE REAL FEAR**

**Heading:** "What Keeps You Up at Night"

**Visual:**
- Dark, atmospheric (darker than other slides)
- Single column of text, centered, clean

**The Fear:**

*"What if I invest in AI...*  
*...and it doesn't work with my team?*

*What if it breaks our current process?*

*What if the vendor disappears?*

*What if we build it wrong?*

*What if I don't even know the right questions to ask?"*

**Pause (white space)**

**Then (smaller, gold text):**
"What if your competitor figures it out first?"

**Talking Points:**
- "These are the questions we asked ourselves when we started Cold Lava."
- "We've been you. We've run businesses."
- "We know what it's like to be sold something that doesn't work in the real world."
- [PAUSE - let it land]
- "That's why we exist."

**Animation:**
- Questions fade in one by one (slow, deliberate)
- White space holds (2 seconds)
- Gold competitor question appears (subtle glow effect)

### **SLIDE 5: THE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE**

**Heading:** "Why Your Competitors Are Winning"

**Visual:**
- Split comparison (not a boring table - dynamic cards)

**LEFT: Your Competitor (using AI properly)**
- ✅ Every lead captured automatically
- ✅ Instant responses, 24/7
- ✅ One system, all their data
- ✅ Decisions made in seconds, not days
- ✅ Team spends time on deals, not admin

**RIGHT: You (without it)**
- ❌ Missed calls = missed revenue
- ❌ Manual follow-ups, delayed responses
- ❌ Data scattered across 12 apps
- ❌ Reporting takes hours
- ❌ Team drowning in repetitive tasks

**Bottom (centered, large, gold text):**
"The gap is widening every day."

**Talking Points:**
- "This isn't about being fancy. It's about survival."
- "Your competitors aren't smarter. They just moved first."
- "But here's the good news: You can catch up faster than they got ahead."
- "Because you don't need to figure it out alone."

**Animation:**
- Left column fades in (green glow)
- Right column fades in (red glow)
- Bottom text appears with emphasis

---

### **SLIDE 6: THE BRIDGE (Transition to Solution)**

**Heading:** "You Need Someone Who Gets It"

**Visual:**
- Minimal, powerful
- Two columns of brief text

**LEFT: What You DON'T Need**
- Silicon Valley's idea of your business
- Another consultant's theory
- A system you have to adapt to
- Vendor lock-in
- A team that disappears at 5pm

**RIGHT: What You DO Need**
- People who've run businesses
- Systems built around YOUR process
- Full ownership of your code
- UK-based, always available
- Partners who've felt your pain

**Center (between columns, gold accent):**
"That's Cold Lava."

**Talking Points:**
- "We're not here to sell you AI for AI's sake."
- "We're here to solve the real problems."
- "The ones the tech bros don't understand."
- [TRANSITION] "Let me show you how..."

**Animation:**
- Left column fades in (slightly dimmed)
- Right column fades in (brighter, emphasized)
- Center text appears last with glow
- Smooth transition to next section (Company)

## 💬 PRESENTER NOTES (Sales Rep Training)

### **Delivery Tips**

**Pace:**
- Slow down for this section
- Let the fear resonate
- Don't rush to the solution

**Tone:**
- Empathetic, not preachy
- "We've been there" not "You're doing it wrong"
- Confident but not arrogant

**Watch for:**
- **Nodding heads** - they're feeling the pain, you're connecting
- **Leaning forward** - they want the solution, time to move on
- **Defensive posture** - you've hit a nerve, acknowledge it gently

### **Discovery Questions to Ask**

**After Slide 1 (The Trap):**
"Which side feels more familiar right now - the fear of moving too fast, or falling behind?"

**After Slide 3 (What Real Business Looks Like):**
"Which of these scenarios hits closest to home for you?"

**After Slide 5 (Unfair Advantage):**
"Do you know who your competitors are using for this? What are you hearing?"

### **Objection Handling**

**If they say: "We're not ready for AI yet"**
→ "That's exactly why we're talking. Because when you ARE ready, you want to do it right. Not rush and waste money."

**If they say: "AI is too expensive"**
→ "What's expensive is missing leads. Or spending 15 hours a week on admin. AI pays for itself in weeks, not years."

**If they say: "We tried AI and it didn't work"**
→ "I hear that a lot. What did you try? [LISTEN] That's the problem - off-the-shelf AI doesn't fit real businesses. That's why we build custom."

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

This section is working if:
- ✅ Prospects say "Yes, that's exactly it" (out loud or nodding)
- ✅ They ask "How do you solve this?" (moving to solution mindset)
- ✅ They share their specific pain (opening up)
- ✅ Energy in the room shifts from skeptical to curious

This section is failing if:
- ❌ Glazed eyes (too much fear, not enough hope)
- ❌ Defensive body language (attacking too hard)
- ❌ Impatience (they already know the problem, get to solution)

**Adjust accordingly:**
- If failing, compress slides 2-4, get to bridge faster
- If working, pause, let them share stories, build connection

---

## 🔄 TRANSITION TO NEXT SECTION

**From Problem → Company:**

**Last line of Slide 6:** "That's Cold Lava."

**First line of Company section:** "So who are we, really?"

**Smooth transition because:**
- They now WANT to know who we are
- We've earned the right to talk about ourselves
- They're ready to hear the solution
