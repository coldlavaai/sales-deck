Hi [Name],

I help [industry] businesses like [their business name] eliminate the daily admin headaches (no-shows, manual reminders, etc.) with simple automations.

Would be happy to share a couple quick wins that could save you 5-10 hours/week. Worth a quick chat?

- [Your Name]

**Cold Email (Subject: "5 hours back per week?")**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much time does your team spend on appointment reminders, booking confirmations, and follow-ups each week?

Most [industry] businesses we work with say 5-10 hours. We've built simple automations that handle all of that automatically — no more missed appointments, no more manual texts.

I'd love to show you a couple quick wins we could implement this week. 15 minutes on a call?

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note from earlier this week.

We just helped a [similar business] eliminate £2,000/month in no-show losses with a simple SMS reminder system. Took us 2 days to set up.

Worth 15 minutes to see if we can do the same for you?

Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

Noticed [Company Name] is scaling fast — how's your team managing the customer inquiry volume?

We build AI chat & voice agents that handle 60-70% of routine questions automatically (order status, FAQs, booking inquiries). Frees up your team for complex issues.

Would you be open to seeing a quick demo? We could even build a prototype for your site.

- [Your Name]

**Cold Email (Subject: "Handle 100+ inquiries/day with 1 agent?")**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because [Company Name] looks like you're growing fast (congrats!) — which usually means your customer service team is drowning in inquiries.

Quick question: How many customer questions do you get per day? And how many are the same 10-15 questions over and over?

We build AI agents (chat + voice) that handle those repetitive questions automatically. Most clients see 60-70% of inquiries resolved instantly — no human needed.

Could save you a full-time hire (or free up your current team for actual problem-solving).

15-minute demo? I'll show you how it works on your actual site.

Try asking it:

It handles all of that instantly — 24/7, no breaks, no sick days.

We could build this for [Company Name] in under 2 weeks. Want to jump on a call and scope it out?

Hi [Name],

Took a quick look at [Company Name]'s website — you're clearly doing great work, but I think your site might be costing you leads.

We specialize in premium websites for [industry] businesses. Most clients see 3-5x more inquiries within 60 days of launch.

Would you be open to a quick site audit? I'll show you exactly where you're losing leads + what we'd do differently.

No obligation, just honest feedback.

- [Your Name]
```

**Cold Email (Subject: "Your website vs [Competitor Name]'s")**
```
Hi [Name],

I was comparing [industry] websites in [city] and noticed [Company Name] vs [Competitor Name].

You're clearly the better business (reviews prove it), but their website makes them LOOK more established. That's costing you leads.

Quick question: How many inquiries per month does your site generate right now?

We build premium websites for [industry] businesses that typically 3x inquiry volume within 90 days.

Would you be open to a 15-minute site audit? I'll show you:
- Where your current site is losing leads
- What [Competitor] is doing better
- How we'd redesign it to win

No obligation. Just honest feedback.

**Follow-Up (After Site Audit Call):**
```
Hi [Name],

Great chatting earlier. As promised, here's the site audit for [Company Name]:

**Current Issues:**
- Mobile experience (47% of visitors leave in <10 seconds)
- No clear CTA above the fold
- Contact form buried on a separate page
- Load time: 8.2 seconds (should be <3s)

**What We'd Do:**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Lead capture form on every page
- Portfolio showcasing your best work
- 2-3 second load time (Google loves this = more traffic)

Estimated impact: 3-5x more inquiries within 60 days.

Investment: £[5,000-8,000] (one-time) + £[150/month] hosting/maintenance.

If you're serious about growing your pipeline, let's do this.

Want to move forward?

Best,
[Your Name]

Hi [Name],

Saw you're building out the sales team at [Company Name] — congrats on the growth!

Quick question: What are you using to track leads right now? (Spreadsheets, CRM, Notion?)

We build custom lead systems for B2B sales teams — think HubSpot, but tailored exactly to your process, no bloat, half the cost.

Most clients cut lead follow-up time from days to hours (huge impact on close rates).

Open to a quick demo?

- [Your Name]

**Cold Email (Subject: "How many leads fell through the cracks last month?")**
```
Hi [Name],

Honest question: How many qualified leads slipped through the cracks last month because someone forgot to follow up?

We work with B2B sales teams like [Company Name] who are growing fast but still tracking leads in spreadsheets (or fighting with clunky CRMs).

We build custom lead management systems that:
- Auto-assign leads based on your rules (territory, size, industry)
- Remind reps when to follow up (no more "I forgot")
- Show you your pipeline in real-time (no more "What's the forecast?" meetings)

Most clients close 20-30% more deals just from NOT losing leads.

15-minute demo? I'll show you how it works with your actual sales process.

- Auto-assignment rules (by territory, size, source)
- Instant Slack/email notifications to rep

**Phase 2: Pipeline Management** (Week 3-4)

- Auto-follow-up reminders
- Real-time dashboard (you can see the entire pipeline)

**Phase 3: Reporting** (Week 5-6)
- Conversion rates by source
- Rep performance (calls, demos, close rate)
- Forecasting (expected revenue by stage)

**Investment:** £[7,000-10,000] (one-time build) + £[300/month] hosting/support

**Expected ROI:** If this helps you close 2-3 extra deals per month, it pays for itself immediately.

Hi [Name],

Managing operations across [X locations] must be challenging — how do you keep visibility on performance across all sites?

We build real-time dashboards for multi-location businesses like [Company Name]. Most executives say it's the first time they've actually seen what's happening across their business in real-time (not last month's Excel report).

Would you be open to a quick demo? I'll show you examples from similar businesses.

```

**Cold Email (Subject: "Real-time visibility across all [X] locations?")**

Hi [Name],

Quick question: When you need to know how [Company Name]'s locations are performing TODAY, where do you look?

Most multi-location businesses we talk to say "I have to ask someone to pull a report" or "I wait for the monthly numbers."

We build real-time dashboards that show you everything in one place:
- Revenue by location (today, this week, this month)
- Inventory levels (live)
- Staff performance (individual + team)
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Key alerts (stock-outs, maintenance issues)

No more waiting for reports. No more spreadsheets. Just real-time data whenever you need it.

Hi [Name],

Saw [Company Name] is growing — have you been struggling to find good people for repetitive tasks (admin, data entry, follow-ups)?

We've built "AI employees" — basically virtual team members that handle repetitive work 24/7. No training, no sick days, no holidays.

Example: One of our clients replaced 2 admin roles with an AI agent. Saved £50K/year and it works faster.

Would you be open to a quick demo? I'll show you what's possible.

- [Your Name]
```

**Cold Email (Subject: "Hire an employee that never takes a day off?")**
```
Hi [Name],

Weird question: What if you could hire someone who:
- Never takes a day off
- Never needs training
- Costs 80% less than a human
- Works 24/7 with perfect accuracy

Sounds too good to be true? We've built "AI employees" for businesses like [Company Name].

Example use case:
- **Insurance broker** - AI agent processes quotes, sends follow-ups, reminds clients about renewals (replaced 1.5 admin staff, saved £45K/year)
- **Recruitment agency** - AI agent screens CVs, sends outreach messages, schedules interviews (handles 200+ candidates/week)

These aren't chatbots. They're actual workers handling real tasks in your systems.

15-minute demo? I'll show you what tasks we could automate for [Company Name].

**Follow-Up (After Demo):**

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the time today. Based on what you shared, here's what we'd automate for [Company Name]:

**AI Employee Tasks:**
1. [Specific task they mentioned] - currently takes [X hours/week]
2. [Second task] - currently done by [person/role]
3. [Third task] - currently a bottleneck

**How It Works:**
- You send a voice note (or type) with the instruction
- AI employee executes it in your systems
- Sends you confirmation when done
- Escalates to you if it hits an exception

**Timeline:** 8-10 weeks from kickoff to deployed

**Investment:** £[15,000-25,000] (one-time build) + £[800/month] usage/support

**ROI Calculation:**
- Current cost of [X] staff handling these tasks: £[Y/year]
- AI employee cost: £[9,600/year] (£800/month)
- Savings: £[Y minus 9,600]
- Payback period: [usually 3-6 months]

Plus: AI works 24/7, no sick days, no holidays, scales instantly.

Hi [Name],

Managing a [trade] business with field teams is no joke — how are you handling job scheduling, customer communication, and invoicing right now?

We've built a Business Operating System specifically for solar installers (but works for any trade business). It handles:
- Quoting (minutes, not hours)
- Job scheduling (drag-and-drop, real-time updates)
- Team tracking (GPS, photo uploads, time tracking)
- Customer portal (they can see job progress)
- Automated invoicing (money hits your account faster)

Our clients typically cut admin time by 60% and speed up invoicing by 2 weeks.

Would you be open to a demo? I can show you the solar version + how we'd customize it for [industry].

**Cold Email (Subject: "How long does it take you to create a quote?")**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How long does it take your team to create a customer quote right now? (Hours? Days?)

Most [trade] businesses we talk to say 2-5 hours per quote (site visit → measurements → spreadsheet → email back and forth).

We've built a Business Operating System for trade businesses like [Company Name] that handles the entire workflow:

**Quoting:** Customer fills out form → system generates instant quote → sends it automatically
**Scheduling:** Drag-and-drop calendar, auto-assigns teams based on location/skills
**Job Tracking:** GPS tracking, photo uploads, time logging (all from mobile)
**Customer Portal:** Clients can see job progress, approve changes, get invoices
**Invoicing:** Auto-generated when job is marked complete → sent same day

Our clients typically:
- Create quotes 10x faster (minutes, not hours)
- Cut admin time by 60%
- Get paid 2 weeks sooner (invoices go out same day)
- Scale without hiring more office staff

We built this for a solar company (it's live and working), but it works for any field service business.

15-minute demo? I'll show you the full system + how we'd customize it for [industry].

Best,
[Your Name]

**Follow-Up (After Demo):**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the call today. Here's what we'd build for [Company Name]:

**Phase 1: Quoting & CRM** (Weeks 1-4)
- Customer inquiry form (website + phone)
- Instant quote generation (based on your pricing rules)
- CRM to track all leads/customers
- Auto-follow-up reminders

**Phase 2: Job Scheduling & Tracking** (Weeks 5-8)
- Drag-and-drop job calendar
- Mobile app for field teams (GPS, photos, notes, time tracking)
- Real-time job status updates
- Customer portal (progress visibility)

**Phase 3: Invoicing & Reporting** (Weeks 9-12)
- Auto-generated invoices (when job marked complete)
- Payment reminders (for overdue invoices)
- Dashboard (revenue, job pipeline, team performance)
- Integrations (Xero, QuickBooks, whatever you use)

**Timeline:** 12-16 weeks from kickoff to fully deployed

**Investment:** £[25,000-50,000] (one-time build) + £[1,200/month] hosting/support

**ROI Calculation:**
- **Time savings:** 60% less admin = ~1.5 FTE worth of work
- **Faster invoicing:** Get paid 2 weeks sooner = better cash flow
- **More quotes:** 10x faster quoting = more opportunities
- **Scalability:** Handle 2-3x more jobs without adding office staff

Most clients hit ROI within 6-9 months, then it's pure profit.

Want to move forward?

Best,
[Your Name]

## 🎯 Universal Lead Gen Tactics (Apply to All Tiers)

### **LinkedIn Strategies**

**Profile Optimization (Do This First):**
- Headline: "I help [industry] businesses [result]" (not "Sales Rep at Cold Lava")
- About section: 3-sentence value prop, link to case studies
- Featured section: Client success stories, demos, testimonials
- Activity: Share helpful content (not salesy) 3x/week

**Connection Request Strategy:**
- Send 10-20 personalized requests per day (LinkedIn limit)
- Mention something specific about their business
- NO pitch in the connection request (build rapport first)
- Follow up 2-3 days after they accept

**LinkedIn Content That Gets Responses:**
- "I just helped a [industry] business solve [problem] — here's how..."
- "3 mistakes I see [industry] businesses making with [topic]..."
- Case study posts (client results, with their permission)
- Before/after comparisons

### **Cold Email Best Practices**

**Deliverability Basics:**
- Send from a real email (not "sales@", not "noreply@")
- Use your actual name (not "Cold Lava Sales Team")
- Keep it short (under 150 words)
- No links in first email (spam filters hate this)
- Personalize the first line (mention their company/industry/pain)

**Subject Line Formulas That Work:**
- Question: "How long does [pain] take you?"
- Curiosity: "Quick question about [Company Name]"
- Value: "[Result] in [timeframe]?"
- Specificity: "For [industry] businesses doing £[X]M+"

**Email Cadence:**
- Day 1: Initial email
- Day 3: Follow-up #1 (add value, don't just "bump")
- Day 7: Follow-up #2 (case study or demo link)
- Day 14: Breakup email ("Should I take you off my list?")

### **Cold Calling Scripts**

**Opening (First 10 Seconds):**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Cold Lava. I know I'm calling out of the blue — do you have 30 seconds?"

[If yes:]
"Great. I help [industry] businesses [result]. I'm calling because I noticed [specific thing about their business]. Is this something you'd want to hear more about?"

[If no:]
"No problem. What's a better time to call back?"
```

**Handling "Send me some information":**
```
"Happy to. Just so I send you the most relevant info — can I ask, what's your biggest challenge with [their pain point] right now?"

[Get them talking, THEN offer to send info + book a follow-up call]
```

### **Follow-Up System (Critical!)**

**The Rule:** 80% of sales happen after the 5th follow-up. Most reps give up after 1-2.

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- **Day 0:** Initial outreach (email/LinkedIn/call)
- **Day 3:** Follow-up (add value: case study, tip, article)
- **Day 7:** Follow-up (different angle: demo link, competitor comparison)
- **Day 14:** Follow-up (social proof: "Just helped [similar company]...")
- **Day 21:** Breakup email ("Should I take you off my list?")

**If they ghost after a demo:**
- **Day 1:** Recap email (what we discussed, next steps)
- **Day 3:** Value add (case study of similar business)
- **Day 7:** Check-in ("Still interested or should I follow up later?")
- **Day 14:** Competitor angle ("Noticed [competitor] just did X...")
- **Day 21:** Breakup email

## ❓ FAQs

**Q: How many prospects should I contact per day?**
A: Aim for 20-30 NEW outreach attempts per day (mix of LinkedIn, email, calls). Plus follow-ups.

**Q: Which tier should I start with?**
A: Start with Tier 1 or 3 (Quick Wins or Websites) — shorter sales cycles, easier to close early wins. Build confidence, then move up-market.

**Q: What if they don't reply?**
A: Follow up! Most people need 5-7 touches before they respond. Don't give up after 1 email.

**Q: Should I focus on one industry or spray and pray?**
A: Pick ONE industry per tier and become the expert. Easier to personalize, easier to build referrals.

**Q: How do I know if they're a good fit?**
A: Use the qualifying questions in each tier section. If they fail 2+ red flags, politely disqualify and move on.
