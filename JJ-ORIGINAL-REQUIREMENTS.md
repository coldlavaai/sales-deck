# JJ's Original Requirements - Sales Deck

**Date:** 2026-02-15  
**Source:** Voice note instructions from JJ  
**Purpose:** Sales rep onboarding + client-facing presentation

---

## 🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Build a sales deck for Cold Lava that serves two purposes:
1. **Sales rep training** - Onboard new reps, teach them what we sell
2. **Client-facing presentation** - Use on live calls to pitch prospects

**Critical:** Match Cold Lava website (coldlava.ai) branding, styling, and vibe exactly.

### **SECTION 3: PRODUCTS / WHAT YOU'RE SELLING** ⚠️ **MOST IMPORTANT**

**Layout:** Nice structured format (dropdowns or similar)

**7 Tiers (in order from website):**
1. Quick Win Automations
2. AI Chat & Voice Agents
3. Premium Websites
4. Lead Systems

6. AI Employees (the voice note agent we use)
7. Business Operating Systems (BOS - flagship)

**For EVERY tier, must include:**
- Tier explanation with examples
- Sales approach
- "Best for" section
- **⭐ CRITICAL: iframe or real working example to demonstrate it**
- Interactive test/demo where possible

**Specific tier requirements:**

**Tier 2: AI Chat & Voice Agents**
- Show live chat widget example + let them test it
- Show live voice agent example + let them test it
- These must be testable/interactive

**Tier 3: Premium Websites**
- iframe showing laptop AND phone view
- Show quality of websites we build
- Use real client examples

**Tier 4-7: Same pattern**
- All need iframes or real examples
- Show, don't just tell
- Interactive where possible

**Important:** If you successfully implement all iframes/examples in Products section → DELETE the Portfolio section. If not → keep Portfolio section.

### **SECTION 4: COMMISSIONS** (Sales Rep deck only)

**A. Sales Rep Commissions**

Structure:
```
Product          Price   Upfront Commission   Recurring Commission
Quick Wins       [TBD]   [TBD]               [TBD]

```

**Note:** Use placeholders - JJ will fill in actual amounts later. Just get framework/layout right.

**B. BDR/Appointment Setter Commissions**

New section needed under "Commission Structure":
- Separate commission structure
- For people who find leads & book appointments (don't close deals)
- Placeholder commission amounts for each of the 7 tiers

### **SECTION 5: SALES POINTS FOR REPS**

Create section explaining our key selling points:

✅ **100% UK-based team**
- Every line of code written by UK developers
- No outsourcing, no offshoring

✅ **Fully bespoke - built from scratch**
- Not off-the-shelf
- Custom solutions only
- Built around YOUR business

✅ **Real world business experience**
- Not just devs in a basement
- We've run businesses
- We understand pain points from experience

✅ **Full code ownership**
- Clients own every line
- No licensing fees
- No vendor dependency

✅ **No vendor lock-in**
- Source code, documentation, full transparency
- You're never trapped

✅ **Anything is possible**
- Custom development means no limits
- If client asks "Can you do X?" → answer is ALWAYS yes

**CTA message:**
"Remember: If a client asks 'Can you do X?' → The answer is ALWAYS yes."

### **SECTION 6: PORTFOLIO** (Conditional)

**Only include if** iframes NOT implemented in Products section.

If needed:
- Grid of project cards
- Greenstar Solar (website + BOS)
- Detail Dynamics (voice agent + website)
- LCB (client delivery systems)
- Solar BOS (if showcasing full BOS)

### **SECTION 7: SIGN-OFF**

### **Copy:**

## 📱 PLATFORM FORMATTING NOTES

**Discord/WhatsApp:** No markdown tables - use bullet lists  
**Discord links:** Wrap multiple links in `<>` to suppress embeds  
**WhatsApp:** No headers - use **bold** or CAPS for emphasis

---

## ⚡ PRIORITY ORDER (AFTER PRESENTATIONS DONE)

**This is THE priority.** Do NOT work on anything else until sales deck is complete.

After sales deck is done:
1. Solar BOS Rollout Planning Call (with JJ)
2. Aztec Planning (with JJ)
3. Aztec becomes primary focus

But for now: **SALES DECK ONLY.**

---

## 🚫 WHAT TO AVOID

Based on previous iterations with JJ:

1. **Don't guess at design** - inspect coldlava.ai and copy exact values
2. **Don't use frameworks without loading them** (e.g., Tailwind classes without Tailwind)
3. **Don't skip the demos** - live examples are the most important part
4. **Don't make it "different"** - match the reference exactly
5. **Test frequently** - don't build everything then test

---

## 📝 NOTES FROM JJ

- "I'll just let Ollie crack on with it" - regarding copy
- "Remember it all has to be in the style of our Cold Lava website"
- "If you can make the user interface more aesthetically pleasing than do"
- "I want it to run in line with the cold lava website - all the same branding background and everything"

**Most important:** Live demos/iframes for every product tier. This is what makes the deck effective on client calls.
